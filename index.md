## Welcome to My Github Blog

I am Chloe, a college student living in Boston. I want to break into Data Science, but don't have a ton of role models to learn from. I decided to document my learning journey on here, mostly to help me keep track of where I am, but also to inspire other peers to embark on a journey of self-learning whatever topic they are interested in.
